                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Rapid Rafters was founded in 2012 with one raft, a used pickup truck, and a bold vision: to bring the thrill of whitewater rafting to everyone—from first-timers to adrenaline junkies. What started as weekend trips down the local river with a handful of adventurous friends quickly turned into something more. Driven by a passion for the outdoors and a commitment to safety, the founders began offering guided tours on the region’s most challenging and scenic rapids, carving a niche for quality experiences with a personal touch.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                As word of mouth spread, so did the demand. Rapid Rafters grew from a backyard startup into a fully licensed and certified outfitter known for its exceptional guides and unforgettable trips. We expanded our operations to include multiple rivers, added professional training programs, and built relationships with local tourism boards to support sustainable adventure tourism. Throughout it all, we stayed true to our roots—treating every guest like family and every trip like an opportunity to create lasting memories.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                Today, Rapid Rafters is proud to be a trusted name in outdoor adventure.
